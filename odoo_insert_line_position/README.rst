This module allows you to insert lines at any position in your list
views.

By default in Odoo, you get two options about where you prefer to enter
new records in your list views. The option is available in ``tree``
views as the attribute ``editable``, and values are ``bottom`` or
``top``. However, what if in some cases you would like to enter a
specific line at a concrete position in your list, maybe your list is
huge, and even have multiple pages and make it very complicated or
impossible to create your new line, and move it (just when a handler for
sequences is available) to your desired position.

For cases like this, with this module you will have a new attribute
available for your ``tree`` views! The new attribute is ``insert``, and
the value for it is a *boolean*.

Installation
============

This is a technical module. Itâ€™s intended to be used by developers, or
at least, by people with a basic understanding of how xml views are
declared in Odoo.

To start using it, just move it to your addons folder, and install the
module.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

-  Create a new list view, and in the ``tree`` tag enter ``insert="1"``.
   Or just simply inherit an existing xml view with a list, and add the
   ``insert="1"``.

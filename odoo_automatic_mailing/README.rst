certain processes under special circumstances, however, if the only
thing that you need is decide different email templates and in which
cases you want them to be sent at Sales Order confirmation or Invoice
validation, this module makes it really easy to start.

based on conditions, like for example, depending on certain kind of
Customers, and choose the email template you want to use for those
situations. An everything in a simple and intuitive way.

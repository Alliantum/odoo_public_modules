To use this module, after having configured it, you can go to a SO a try to sell a product, using fractions for the UoM Category that you just configured:

You should then receive a warning while you're editing those quantities to sell, and even if you continue and try to save your changes, and exception will be raised, and will not be possible to save the current SO (or Invoice).

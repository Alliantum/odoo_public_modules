## Disclaimer

The current module makes use of the Python package [pyzint](https://pypi.org/project/pyzint/) for the rendering of the barcodes, which is a c-api binding to the c library [Zint](https://github.com/zint/zint). Please head over to the pyzint [project's repository](https://github.com/Pavkazzz/pyzint) for more information and examples on how the package works.

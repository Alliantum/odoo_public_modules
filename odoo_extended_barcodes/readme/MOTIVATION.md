In general, the default types of barcodes that Odoo is able to generate is all you may need for most of your business processes.

But sometimes, may raise situations when those barcodes are very limited or don't behave as well as expected. For example, you may need to print very small barcodes inside a very constraint space in one of your documents, but the resulting Odoo's barcode doesn't look good, it can be too blurry to be read by a barcode scanner, while, for example using a different type of barcode (maybe a DataMatrix) can work much better than a traditional linear barcode.
